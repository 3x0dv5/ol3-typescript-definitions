# ol3-typescript-definitions (ol.3.1.1)
Typescript definitions for OpenLayers 3.

These definitions were done using https://github.com/fivetran/typescript-closure-tools and a big amount of manual work.

# git submodule update
After cloning as follows (you may change to clone from your fork): 
```
C:\github\> git clone https://github.com/3x0dv5/ol3-typescript-definitions.git 
```

If you don't have the closure-library definitions, you'll need to update the submodules. 
```
C:\github\> cd .\ol3-typescript-definitions
C:\github\ol3-typescript-definitions [master]> git submodule update --init
```
